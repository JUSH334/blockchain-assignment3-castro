# CampusCredit Token Project Write-up

## 1. Security Enforcement Implementation

### Cap Enforcement
The token cap of 2,000,000 CAMP is enforced at multiple levels:

1. **ERC20Capped Extension**: OpenZeppelin's `ERC20Capped` automatically checks the cap in its `_update` function, preventing any mint operation that would exceed the maximum supply.

2. **Airdrop Pre-validation**: In the `airdrop` function (lines 92-95), I calculate the total amount to be minted before execution:
   ```solidity
   if (totalSupply() + totalAmount > cap()) {
       revert CapExceeded(totalSupply() + totalAmount, cap());
   }
   ```
   This fail-fast approach saves gas by catching violations before attempting any mints.

3. **Constructor Validation**: The initial mint is validated against the cap immediately in the constructor, preventing deployment with invalid parameters.

### Pause Mechanism
The pause functionality is implemented through OpenZeppelin's `ERC20Pausable`:

- The `_update` function (lines 124-130) is overridden to include pause checks
- When paused, ALL token transfers are blocked, including mints and burns
- Only accounts with `PAUSER_ROLE` can execute `pause()` and `unpause()` functions
- This provides an emergency stop mechanism for the entire token economy

### Role-Based Access Control
Three distinct roles protect administrative functions:

1. **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE**: Can grant/revoke other roles (deployer initially)
2. **MINTER_ROLE**: Guards `mint()` (line 79) and `airdrop()` (line 88) functions
3. **PAUSER_ROLE**: Guards `pause()` (line 60) and `unpause()` (line 68) functions

The `onlyRole` modifier ensures unauthorized calls revert immediately, saving gas and providing security.

## 2. Gas Savings Analysis

Based on actual execution data from the terminal outputs:

### Measured Results
- **Batch Airdrop** (3 recipients): 96,162 gas
- **Individual Transfers** (3 Ã— transfer): 104,795 gas total
- **Gas Saved**: 8,633 gas (8.24% reduction)
- **Fee Saved**: 7,612,890,273,110 wei (2.96% reduction)

### Why Batch Airdrop Saves Gas

1. **Transaction Overhead Reduction**: One transaction signature verification (21,000 gas base) vs. three, saving ~42,000 gas on base costs alone.

2. **Shared Function Selector**: The function selector (4 bytes) is read once instead of three times, saving ~200 gas.

3. **Optimized Loops**: Using `unchecked { ++i }` in loops saves ~80 gas per iteration by skipping overflow checks on the iterator.

4. **State Access Optimization**: Role checks, pause checks, and cap checks happen once instead of three times, saving multiple SLOAD operations (~2,100 gas each).

5. **Single Event Emission Overhead**: While we still emit individual Transfer events, the transaction receipt handling is consolidated.

The 8.24% savings would increase significantly with more recipients - the efficiency gains scale linearly with batch size.

## 3. Issues Encountered and Solutions

### Issue 1: DIDLab Network Connectivity
**Problem**: Could not connect to assigned endpoint `https://hh-08.didlab.org` (Chain ID 31344).
**Solution**: Pivoted to local Hardhat network development, maintaining identical functionality and comprehensive testing. All scripts support both local and DIDLab deployment via network flags.

### Issue 2: Gas Estimation Variance
**Problem**: Initial transfer used 29,881 gas, but subsequent transfers to new addresses used 37,469 gas.
**Solution**: This is expected behavior - first transfer to an address changes storage from zero to non-zero (more expensive). Accounted for this in gas comparison by using total gas across all transfers.

### Issue 3: Self-Transfer Edge Case
**Problem**: The initial transfer test showed no balance change (self-transfer).
**Solution**: While valid for testing gas costs, added support for `RECIPIENT` environment variable to enable transfers to different addresses for clearer demonstration.

### Issue 4: Event Decoding Complexity
**Problem**: Role identifiers appeared as bytes32 hashes in events, making logs hard to read.
**Solution**: Implemented proper event filtering and formatting in `logs-query.ts` to display role names and properly decode all event arguments.

### Issue 5: ESM Module Configuration
**Problem**: Hardhat v3 requires ESM but TypeScript configuration was initially incorrect.
**Solution**: Added `"type": "module"` to package.json and adjusted all import statements to use ESM syntax. Used proper file extensions in imports where needed.

## Conclusion

Despite network connectivity challenges, the project successfully implements all required features with measurable gas optimizations. The 8.24% gas savings on batch operations demonstrates the value of thoughtful smart contract design, especially for high-volume operations like token airdrops. The modular architecture using OpenZeppelin v5 ensures security best practices while maintaining upgradeability for future enhancements.
